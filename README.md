## Made for GNOME & Flatpak

Clairvoyant is designed and developed on and for GNOME. As such, contributors agree to abide by the [GNOME Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct).

Clairvoyant is distributed and supported [only on Flathub]. Versions using other packagaging formats or on other app stores are **not** supported by me and may not work the same.

If you're on elementary OS, **the AppCenter version is no longer maintained or receiving updates.** Install from [Flathub] to get the latest design and future updates.

## Developing and Building

I recommend using GNOME Builder for development.
