## Made for GNOME & Flatpak

Clairvoyant is designed and developed on and for GNOME. As such, contributors agree to abide by the [GNOME Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct).

Clairvoyant is only distributed as a Flatpak via [Flathub]. Other packagaging formats and app stores are **not** supported by me.

## Developing and Building

I recommend using GNOME Builder for development.
